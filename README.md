## Description:

This application is a content management system (CMS) that allows a hypothetical business owner to manage their company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

The functionality of this application will be displayed via video clip as requested by the assignment's Grading Requirements.

The assignment's User Story and Acceptance Criteria can be found in their own sections below.
